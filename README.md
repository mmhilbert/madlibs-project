## Deployment

The Rad Libs application is deployed on GitHub Pages. You can access it [here](https://mmhilbert.github.io/madlibs-project/).

## User Story

As a user, I want to play an interactive Mad Libs-style game where I can fill in blanks to create a funny story. I also want to see a relevant image alongside the completed story.

## Motivation for Development

We developed Rad Libs to create a fun and engaging way for users to interact with classic Mad Libs stories in a digital format. By incorporating relevant images, we aimed to enhance the user experience and add visual interest to the stories.

## Process

### Technologies

- We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the frontend of the application.
- We used JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- We used local browser storage to store the image URL and story.
- We integrated the Mad Libs API to fetch stories and blanks dynamically.
- The Unsplash API was used to retrieve relevant images based on the story title.
